        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground lamb</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) jars grape leaves, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 kalamata olives (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>GSoak rice in cold water, and drain. Mix together ground lamb, rice, allspice, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well blended. Place about 1 tablespoon of the meat mixture onto the center of each grape leaf. Fold leaf over once, turn in the edges on each side, and then roll the leaf closed.</li>
        <li>Stack leaf rolls in a large pot, covering each layer with slices of garlic. Add just enough water to cover rolls, then pour in lemon juice. Add olives to the pot for flavoring. Place a plate on top of the rolls to keep them under the water.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 1 hour 15 minutes. Taste rice for doneness. Grape leaves taste even better after sitting for several hours. Serve and enjoy.</li>
